/**
    An Event is a record of a the data and location associated with an instance of a set of identification criteria
    (a collection of IDCriterion subclasses) evaluating as True in a Sector.
    
    For example, if an IDCriterion is defined to identify vorticity maxima greater than a threshold, when it encounters
    such a value in the data, it creates an Event with a description like "VortMax", the data value, location in 
    physical space (lat-lon coords), location in time as a DateTime instance, location in data space ll_index_type currently,
    the filename that contains the Event, the time index in that file that corresponds to the Event's time, and the Event
    type enum.
    
    The Event class is one of the fundamental StrideSearch classes (along with Sector and IDCriterion).
